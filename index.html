 <p>The <em> Pangolin</em> is awesome because its harmless, sweet and endangered anaimal. It on the verge of being extnict and they are heavily hunted for their scales for medicne even when it doesnt do anything. The creature only eats ants and is just so cute it even rolls up into a ball. <strong></strong>.</p>
